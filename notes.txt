So, to get an input back from an input box:
- The form must be POST
- Type of button is submit
- Create a forms.py. If there is a database connected, add a model field, otherwise just specify the fields (in this case, inherit from forms.Form and specify the type of the each field)
- In views, if request method is post, the form is bounded to the POST data. otherwise, make it an unbounded form. Sth like this:
   if request.method == "POST":
        form = Form(request.POST)

        #do things here
        if form.is_valid():
            var = form.cleaned_data['field_1']
            var_from_the_db = ...
            var_from_the_db.save()
    else:
        form = Form()
- To display, make it a context data (so it's accessible in the template). Otherwise, save() it to the template
